# CIFAR-100-Image-Classification-Models

This project was part of the course work for DS5220: Supervised Machine Learning at Northeastern University. The project involves the implementation and comparison of several supervised learning models on the CIFAR-100 dataset, focusing on enhancing model performance through feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and regularization techniques.

## Project Overview

In this project, the following machine learning models were applied on the CIFAR-100 dataset to analyze their performance and improve classification accuracy:

	1.	Support Vector Machine (SVM) without kernel
	2.	SVM with Radial Bias Function (RBF) kernel
	3.	Logistic Regression
	4.	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

We processed and normalized the CIFAR-100 dataset, explored dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and experimented with feature extraction using ResNet model weights.
